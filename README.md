# Destiny Random Loadout

Bored of playing the meta in Destiny? Why not roll the dice and equip any old tat you have lying around, you never know, you might just like it! (might...)

Destiny Random Loadout is a chrome extension you can use to quickly suggest a random loadout of weapons for whatever game mode you're into, though most fun in the Crucible.

## Installation & Use

1. Download this repo and extract the folder.
2. Go to your extensions in chrome at `chrome://extensions` and select the tick box for `Developer mode` (if not already selected).
3. Click the `Load unpacked extension...` button and select the repo from the file browser.
4. Go to the Bungie Gear Manager web app and click the chrome extension icon.
5. Click `Get Gear` to pull your armory data into the extension, then click `Randomize` to display a random weapon loadout.

## Known Issues

If `Get Gear` isn't changing the red light to green, you may need to refresh the page.
